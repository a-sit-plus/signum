# Development

Development happens in branch [development](https://github.com/a-sit-plus/signum/tree/development). The main branch always tracks the latest release.
Hence, create PRs against `development`. Use dedicated `release/x.y.z` branches to prepare releases and create release PRs against `main`, which will then be merged back into `development`.

**Clone recursively, since we depend on a forked swift-klib plugin which is includes ad a git submodule"

## Publishing

Create a GPG key with `gpg --gen-key`, and export it with `gpg --keyring secring.gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`. Be sure to publish it with `gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys <your-key-id>`. See also the information in the [Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html).

Create a user token for your Nexus account on <https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/> (in your profile) to use as `sonatypeUsername` and `sonatypePassword`.

Configure your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
signing.keyId=<last-8-chars>
signing.password=<private-key-password>
signing.secretKeyRingFile=<path-of-your-secring>
sonatypeUsername=<user-token-name>
sonatypePassword=<user-token-password>
```

To run the pipeline from GitHub, export your GPG key with `gpg --export-secret-keys --armor <keyid> | tee <keyid>.asc` and set the following environment variables:

```shell
ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingKeyId=<last-8-chars>
ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingKey=<ascii-armored-key>
ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingPassword=<private-key-password>
ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypeUsername=<user-token-name>
ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypePassword=<user-token-password>
```

Actually, these environment variables are read from the repository secrets configured on Github.

Publish with:

```shell
./gradlew clean publishToSonatype
```

To also release the artifacts to Maven Central run:

```shell
./gradlew clean publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
```

To publish locally for testing, one can skip the signing tasks:

```shell
./gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal -x signJvmPublication -x signKotlinMultiplatformPublication -x signIosArm64Publication -x signIosSimulatorArm64Publication -x signIosX64Publication
```

## Creating a new release

Create a release branch and do the usual commits, i.e. setting the version number and so on. Push it to Github. Run the workflow "Build iOS Framework", and attach the artefacts to the release info page on GitHub. Use the link from there to update the [Swift Package](https://github.com/a-sit-plus/swift-package-signum), modifying `Package.swift` and entering the URLs. The checksum is the output of `sha256sum *framework.zip`.
