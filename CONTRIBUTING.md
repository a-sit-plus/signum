# Contributing to A-SIT Plus Open Source

</div>

We are happy to receive external contributions!
"Just" opening issues for encountered problems is greatly appreciated too!

## Reporting Issues

We welcome constructive feedback and enquiries of any kind! Just be sure to check existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
Please try to be as precise as possible and provide a reproducer (where applicable).

## Contributing Changes

We expect the contributor to hold all rights to the contributions they are about to commit.
We particularly condemn copyright infringement and expect contributors to respect this position and strictly observe applicable law!

If you plan on contributing changes to this repository's contents, please

1. Fork it
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name (e.g. `feature/timeTravel` or `fix/gravitationalConstant`)
3. Commit your changes to your branch
4. Open a pull request

We will then review the changes, provide feedback.
Once we agree that the PR is ready, we will approve it, and your PR will be merged.

### Coding Conventions

We try to follow the [official Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) and expect the same from external contributors.
We don't have any automated checks in place and hence don't strictly enforce convention rules by hard, but we will manually check for obvious violations.
To put it plain and simple:

> When in Rome, do as the Romans do!

### Contributor Licence Agreement

You must sign the [A-SIT Plus Contributor Licence Agreement](https://a-sit-plus.github.io/ASP_CLA.pdf) (CLA) before we can review your PR.
This is a one-time requirement and applies to all A-SIT Plus open-source projects, which indicate to require external contributors to sign the CLA (such as this project).
If you want to know more about what a CLA is and why some legal entities require contributors to sign it, check out the [Wikipedia page about CLAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement).

Please download and fill out the [A-SIT Plus CLA](https://a-sit-plus.github.io/ASP_CLA.pdf).
Either print, sign, and scan it or (preferably) use an eIDAS-compliant qualified electronic signature.
When done, send the signed CLA to opensource@a-sit.at.

Information on the processing of your personal data can be found in the [A-SIT Plus Privacy Policy](https://a-sit-plus.github.io/ASP_Privacy.pdf).
Be sure to carefully read it and only sign the CLA if you accept the terms of this privacy policy! (Don't worry it's a light read!)
You will receive a confirmation message once we have received and processed your CLA.

You are, of course, free to start your work prior to signing the CLA, but the review process can only start after we have received a signed copy of the CLA.
We employ automated checks as part of our CI pipeline to verify external contributors have signed indeed the CLA.
Accordingly, if you do open a PR prior to signing the CLA, the pipeline will fail and a publicly visible message will appear, tagging all contributors who still need to sign the CLA, including instructions on how to proceed.
Once all contributors have signed the CLA, we will re-run the automated CLA checks.
If all checks pass (i.e. all contributors have signed the CLA) we will start reviewing your contributions.

If you have any questions on this matter don't hesitate to contact opensource@a-sit.at!
